                    "Mandi", a web-app, was designed to keep track of all the mandi prices published by Indian
                    Government. The app uses Mandi API to fetch data from their website and display it for users to
                    follow up on.
                    This app originated from the idea to help people with an interactive and easily 'navigatable' app to
                    follow up on horticulture products they love.
